# infinite-zip-unzipper

Some ctf competitions may have thousands of zip files in a zip. This code can be used to open zip files with consecutively decreasing names. Let's imagine a scenario like this, 10000 zip files are nested and their names are decreasing 1 by 1. If you rename the file.zip file in the script to 10000, it will open them all for you. Set the stop.zip to whatever number you want it to stop at.
